# Autocomplete

**_(Also called )_**

- Autosuggest

<Callout type="warning">
  This page is a work in progress. Don't consider it complete yet.
</Callout>

## Overview

The **Autocomplete** is an interactive input component that help users quickly find and select values from a predefined list of options as they type.

They combine the flexibility of text input with dropdown-style selection, providing suggestions that match the user's input in real-time. This pattern reduces errors, speeds up data entry, and improves the overall form completion experience.

## Use Cases

### When to use:

- When users need to select from a large set of predefined options (e.g., country selection, airport codes)
- When you want to help users find and select options more quickly than scrolling through a long dropdown
- When you want to reduce errors by guiding users to valid input options
- When the input has a finite set of valid responses that are known in advance
- When you want to combine free text input with suggestion functionality

### When not to use:

- When there are fewer than 10 options (use a standard dropdown/select instead)
- When users need to enter completely free-form text without restrictions
- When all options need to be visible at once for comparison
- When network latency could significantly delay suggestion results
- When the input field requires exact, verbatim text entry (like passwords)
