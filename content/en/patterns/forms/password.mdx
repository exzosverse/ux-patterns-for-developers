# Password

import { BrowserSupport } from "@app/_components/browser-support";
import { BuildEffort } from "@app/_components/build-effort";

## Overview

A **Password Input** is a specialized text field designed to securely collect user passwords. It masks characters to prevent onlookers from reading the input and may include additional security features such as password visibility toggles, strength indicators, and validation requirements.

Password fields are commonly used in **authentication forms, account creation, and security-related input fields** where sensitive data entry is required.

## Use Cases

### When to use:

- **Login and authentication forms** – Securing user access to accounts.
- **Account creation and password updates** – Ensuring users create strong, secure passwords.
- **Two-factor authentication (2FA) or PIN entry** – Protecting access to critical information.
- **Security-sensitive fields** – Protecting data such as encryption keys or private access codes.

### When not to use:

- **For non-sensitive text input** – Use a standard [text field](/patterns/forms/text-field) instead.
- **For one-time codes (OTP) or PINs** – Use the [Code Confirmation](/patterns/forms/code-confirmation) pattern instead.
- **For password confirmation fields** – Use an inline validation approach to avoid user frustration.

## Benefits

- **Enhances security** – Prevents passwords from being visible to onlookers.
- **Reduces accidental exposure** – Masks characters by default.
- **Encourages strong password usage** – Supports strength indicators and validation rules.
- **Supports accessibility** – Allows users to toggle visibility when needed.

## Drawbacks

- **Usability concerns** – Masking can lead to mistyped passwords.
- **Increased cognitive load** – Users may struggle to recall their input without visibility.
- **Potential security trade-offs** – Some password visibility toggles may pose a risk if not well-implemented.

## Best Practices

### Content & Usability

**Do's ✅**

- Provide a **password visibility toggle** to allow users to verify input.
- Display **clear error messages** when password criteria are not met.
- Indicate **password requirements before users type** to prevent frustration.
- Offer **password strength indicators** to encourage secure choices.
- Allow **paste functionality** to support password managers.

**Don'ts ❌**

- Don’t enforce **arbitrary complexity rules** (e.g., forcing special characters unnecessarily).
- Avoid disabling **autofill** unless there is a valid security reason.
- Don’t store passwords in plaintext or insecurely transmit them.

### Accessibility

**Do's ✅**

- Ensure the password toggle is **keyboard accessible**.
- Use **aria-describedby** to associate password requirements with the input field.
- Maintain **high contrast and clear focus states**.
- Allow users to **verify their input** without compromising security.

**Don'ts ❌**

- Don’t rely on placeholder text for password guidance—it disappears when users type.
- Avoid requiring **excessive special characters** that make passwords difficult to remember.
- Don’t assume all users can see visual strength indicators—provide **text-based guidance**.

### Security Considerations

**Do's ✅**

- Use **secure hashing algorithms** when storing passwords.
- Enforce **rate-limiting and lockouts** for repeated failed attempts.
- Implement **2FA options** for high-security applications.
- Allow **longer passphrases** for enhanced security.

**Don'ts ❌**

- Don’t log passwords in any form.
- Avoid showing **password hints** that expose sensitive information.
- Don’t rely solely on client-side validation—perform checks on the server as well.

### Layout & Positioning

**Do's ✅**

- Place password fields **close to their confirmation fields** if applicable.
- Use **inline validation** to inform users of errors in real time.
- Ensure adequate **spacing and alignment** for clarity.

**Don'ts ❌**

- Avoid forcing **password confirmation fields** unless absolutely necessary.
- Don’t position error messages far from the field they relate to.

## Testing Guidelines

### Functional Testing

**Should ✓**

- [ ] Verify that the password field **masks input by default**.
- [ ] Ensure the **password visibility toggle works correctly**.
- [ ] Test **autofill and password manager compatibility**.
- [ ] Validate that **password strength indicators update dynamically**.

### Accessibility Testing

**Should ✓**

- [ ] Ensure **screen readers announce password requirements and errors clearly**.
- [ ] Confirm **toggle visibility button is keyboard navigable**.
- [ ] Check for **high contrast between text and background**.

### Security Testing

**Should ✓**

- [ ] Ensure **passwords are encrypted before storage**.
- [ ] Validate that **passwords are never logged or stored in plaintext**.
- [ ] Test **rate-limiting and brute-force protections**.
